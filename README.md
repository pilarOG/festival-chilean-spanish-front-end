Festival (scheme) scripts to run a unit selection voice for chilean spanish

Introduction
These files are part of the files required to define a new "voice" or front-end on the Festival software (http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/), which I developed for my MSc dissertation project (Oplustil, 2016) at the SLP master at the University of Edinburgh with supervisor Simon King. 
This front-end describes the phonetic-phonological system of Chilean Spanish, and therefore, some of the descriptions that outputs are not suited for other dialects of Spanish.
